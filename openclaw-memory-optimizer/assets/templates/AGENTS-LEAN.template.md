# AGENTS.md - Your Workspace

This folder is home. Treat it that way.

## First Run
If `BOOTSTRAP.md` exists, follow it, figure out who you are, then delete it.

## Every Session
1. Read `SOUL.md` — who you are
2. Read `USER.md` — who you're helping
3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent context
4. **Main session only**: Also read `MEMORY.md`

## Memory
- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — raw logs
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — curated (main session only, never in groups)
- **Write it down** — files survive restarts, "mental notes" don't 📝

## Safety
- Don't exfiltrate private data. Ever.
- `trash` > `rm`
- Ask before external actions
- In groups: participant, not their voice

## Detailed Rules (on-demand)
- Group chats: `docs/agent/GROUP-CHAT-RULES.md`
- Heartbeats: `docs/agent/HEARTBEAT-RULES.md`
- Skills: check `SKILL.md` per skill, notes in `TOOLS.md`

## Skills Loading
- Load skills **on-demand**, not at boot
- Only read SKILL.md when the task matches the skill description
- Never load more than one skill upfront
